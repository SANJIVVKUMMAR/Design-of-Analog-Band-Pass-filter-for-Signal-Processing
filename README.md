Reconstruction of Analog Band Pass Signal
Project was focused on the reconstruction of the analog bandpass signal. A system is successfully designed and implemented in MATLAB. The performance of the system is verified by comparing the amplitude response of the original and the reconstructed signals.
Reconstructed signal had the same frequency as the original signal which can be seen from the fourier transform of original and reconstructed signal. Nyquist criterion determines the recontruction quality of signal with respect to original.
